**4 Reasons Why Social Media Make Us Vulnerable to Manipulation**

As social media become major channels for the diffusion of
news and information, it becomes critical to understand how the
complex interplay between cognitive, social, and algorithmic biases
triggered by our reliance on online social networks makes us
vulnerable to manipulation and disinformation. This talk overviews
ongoing network analytics, modeling, and machine learning efforts to
study the viral spread of misinformation and to develop tools for
countering the online manipulation of opinions.

**The nature of testimony â€“ or why we are more vulnerable to misinformation than we think**

Over the past few years, public perception of online social media has shifted from a sense that these are merely new technological platforms that otherwise leave communication with others largely unchanged on to a belief that online social media may actually present a new, and deep, threat to societies. At the same time, much research seeks to devise tools and strategies to help protect individuals from misinformation. However, establishing that (and how) online networks materially affect our beliefs about the world is difficult. In this context, the talk outlines insights that might be gained by considering, from first principles, how rational actors should approach testimonial information from others. Through simulations and experiments it is demonstrated how simple changes to our communication networks may profoundly affect the accuracy of our beliefs, and that such network effects go beyond what one could expect current tools and strategies recommended in the literature to be suitable for. In other words, it is shown how the very nature of testimony makes us individually and collectively vulnerable to misinformation and miscalibration of our beliefs.
