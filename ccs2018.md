The Opladyn team organizes one of the Satellites of the [Conference on Complex System 2018](https://ccs2018.web.auth.gr/), that will take place at the Vellidio Convention Center, Tessaloniki, Greece, on September 26th, 2018.

The OpLaDyn satellite is an interdisciplinary meeting bringing together scientists of different fields, interested in the study of opinion and language dynamics seen as  complex systems, by the application of methods and concepts taken from a variety of disciplines like Physics, Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Law.

The aim of this meeting is to discuss how to bring data based models, and  theoretical  models based on the interactions between agents,  into a common framework, in order to understand general features of the evolution of opinions and language.

In particular, we are interested in discussing how to extract valuable information from the  massive amount of textual data available nowadays in numerical form, which are issued from very different sources, like social media (twitter) or more  traditional sources  (journals or books), searching for patterns  characterizing the dynamics of those systems. This  will provide  well defined steady states to be compared with the states of the dynamics governing theoretical model based on agent-agent interactions.
