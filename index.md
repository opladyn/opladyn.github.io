The [OpLaDyn team](http://project.u-cergy.fr/~opladyn/) organizes one of the
satellites at [Networks 2021](https://networks2021.net/){:target="_blank"}, that will take place as a
remote conference, on TODO:datetime, 2021.

The formation and diffusion of opinions in a society, a typical object of study of social sciences, is also of
interest for physicists and mathematicians as it can be formulated in terms of complex dynamical systems.

On one hand, different models have been proposed, which aim at understanding how the observed
regularities, like consensus, polarization or fragmentation, emerge from a dynamics governed by the
interactions among social actors. These models are stylized simplified versions of real societies which
integrate, in general, the most widespread properties of human interactions considered by researchers in
social human sciences.

On the other hand, the last decade has witnessed the generalization of the usage of social networks, leading
to an unprecedented modification of social behavior and in parallel, allowing for large scale
phenomenological studies of the outcomes of the dynamical processes going on in those networks. This has
led to a wide collection of observations that, though limited to the users of these platforms, provide a
widespread view in terms of geographical location, language and cultural aspects of the involved social
actors.

Therefore the [OpLaDyn team](http://project.u-cergy.fr/~opladyn/) organizes this satellite to contribute to
the entanglement of the theoretical and phenomenological approaches, which are still too often considered
separately, into one that goes "from models to data and back".
[We welcome contributions](call.md) from scientists of different fields, interested in the study of opinion and
language dynamics seen as complex systems, by the application of methods and concepts taken from a variety
of disciplines like Physics, Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Law.
